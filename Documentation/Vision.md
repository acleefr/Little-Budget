# Vision

## Context
Managing personal finances is hard without the right tools. I built a Notion database that tracks expenses, accounts, and cash flow. While itâ€™s functional, it lacks automation, insights, and UX made for daily useâ€”especially on mobile.

### Current Expense Entity
- **Date:** Date of the transaction
- **Amount:** Float
- **Status:** Text (ex: planned, paid)
- **Category:** Text (food, transport, etc.)
- **Rule:** Text (need, want, saving, income)
- **Bank Account:** Text (source or destination)

---

## Problems to Solve
The Notion setup has several limitations:
- Double entries required for internal transfers
- No automatic KPIs or analytics
- No "health score" overview
- No percentage breakdowns per category
- No saver profile or financial behavior insights
- No advice or recommendations
- Poor phone usability

---

## Product Vision
A personal finance **Web App (mobile-first)** that:
- Simplifies data entry
- Automatically calculates KPIs
- Gives insights & tips to improve saving behavior
- Shows real-time financial health
- Works well on phone screens
- Scalable to native iOS in the future
